1. PST = Product Structure Template
2. IOI = Item of Interest
3. PSN = Product Structure Name
4. PST is a structure comprising of PSN, Category and IOI.
5. PSN is a unique identifier and is the root element for a product structure.
6. Category is immediate children of PSN. There are multiple categories for a PSN.
7. IOI have Category as immediate parent. There are multiple IOI for a Category.
8. IOI is a leaf element and does not have any children.
9. PST is a tree structure.
10. A typical PSN comprises of name, type(value Product Structure Name) and attributes persisted a json as below:
{
  "name": "PSN1",
  "type": "Product Structure Name",
  "attributes": {
    "Segment": "Ultrasound",
    "Sub Segment": "Virtual Care",
    "OPH Modality Code": "950",
    "OPH Modality Code Description": "Virtual Care"
  }
}
11. A typical Category comprises of name, type(value Category) and attributes persisted a json as below:
{
  "name": "Category1",
  "type": "Category",
  "attributes": {
    "Item Min": "0",
    "Item Max": "1",
    "Category Min": "0",
    "Category Max": "1",
  }
}
12. A typical IOI comprises of name, type(value Item of Interest) and attributes persisted a json as below:
{
  "name": "IOI1",
  "type": "Item of Interest",
  "attributes": {
    "Item Type": "Item of Interest",
    "Item Min": "0",
    "Item Max": "1",
    "Category Min": "0",
    "Category Max": "1",
  }
}

** all values mentioned above are placeholders and can be replaced with actual values other than type which is a constant value.
13. User has to create an instance of PSN and IOI and register them in "entity" table.
14. Validate below items:
    a. PSN and IOI are unique.No duplicate having same PSN and IOI name are allowed.
    b. Segment, OPH Modality Code is mandatory for a PSN.
    c. item Min, item Max, Category Min is mandatory for a IOI.Category Max is optional but if blank should be defaulted to 999.
    e. IOI is unique for a Category.

15. Once PSN and IOI are created user can create a PST by selecting a PSN and adding Categories and IOI to it.
16. PST structure is as below:
[{"Item Name":"AD_TEST_PSN030602","Item Type":"Product Structure Name","Parent":"","Item Min":"0","Item Max":"1","Category Min":"0","Category Max":"2","Create Legacy Check":"No"},{"Item Name":"CONSOLE","Item Type":"Category","Parent":"AD_TEST_PSN030602","Item Min":"0","Item Max":"1","Category Min":"0","Category Max":"1","Create Legacy Check":"No"},{"Item Name":"AD_TEST_IOI030602","Item Type":"Lead Item","Parent":"CONSOLE","Item Min":"16","Item Max":"16","Category Min":"0","Category Max":"1","Create Legacy Check":"No"},{"Item Name":"CONSOLE COMPONENTS","Item Type":"Category","Parent":"AD_TEST_PSN030602","Item Min":"0","Item Max":"1","Category Min":"0","Category Max":"1","Create Legacy Check":"No"},{"Item Name":"AD_TEST_IOI030603","Item Type":"Item of Interest","Parent":"CONSOLE COMPONENTS","Item Min":"15","Item Max":"16","Category Min":"0","Category Max":"1","Create Legacy Check":"No"}]
17. Category will be created when the input PST structure is validated.
18. Category name will persisted as "Item Name"+"_"+id from entity table for PSN.
19. Below validation has to be performed for the input PST:
    c. item Min, item Max, Category Min is mandatory for a Category.Category Max is optional but if blank should be defaulted to 999.
    f. Category Min for Category should be greater than or equal to sum of all Category Mix for all IOIs under a Category.
    g. Category Min and Category Max should be same for all Categories under a PSN.
    h. Category Max should be greater than Category Min.
    i. Item Max should be greater than Item Min.
    j. Category Max should be greater than Item Max.
    k. Category Min should be less than Item Min.
    l. Category Min should be less than Item Max.
    m. Category Max should be greater than Item Min.
    n. Category Max should be greater than Item Max.
    o. Category Min should be less than Item Min.
    p. Category Min should be less than Item Max.
    q. Category Max should be greater than Item Min.
    r. Category Max should be greater than Item Max.
    s. Category Min should be less than Item Min.
    t. Category Min should be less than Item Max.
    u. Category Max should be greater than Item Min.
    v. Category Max should be greater than Item Max.
    w. Category Min should be less than Item Min.
    x. Category Min should be less than Item Max.
    y. Category Max should be greater than Item Min.
    z. Category Max should be greater than Item Max.
