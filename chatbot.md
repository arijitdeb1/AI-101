A personalised ChatBot which will generate response to user queries based on the contents in uploaded PDF file.
Follow below steps - 

1. In the terminal of IDE , run - 

       pip install streamlit pypdf2 langchain langchain-community faiss-cpu tiktoken

    It'll install the required libraries for the ChatBot- 

    **streamlit**  - _lib to create UI interfaces_

    **pypdf2** - _read PDF source file_

    **langchain** - _interface to use OpenAi APIs_

    **faiss-cpu** - _vector store to store Embeddings_

2. Create a new python file - `chatbot.py` 
3. Follow below Architecture to create the ChatBot -

4. First step to upload the PDF file using a UI portal provided by **`streamlit`**
5. Once the file is uploaded, read the contents of the PDF file using **`pypdf2`**
6. Split the contents into chunks of text using **`langchain.text_splitter`** for better and focussed processing. Specifications for chunking(chunk_size, separator etc.) can be provided as per requirement.
7. Use **`langchain-community`** to get the embeddings for each chunk of text. Generate and Use API Keys from OpenAI to get the embeddings.
8. Store the embeddings in a Vector Store provided by **`faiss-cpu`** for faster retrieval and processing.
9. Run the application and follow as instructed or run below command - 

       streamlit run d:/projects/AI-101/chatbot.py
10. Once started control will redirect t default browser having URL - `http://localhost:8501`
11. Hit the URL and upload the PDF .
12. Upload provided sample file - [Constitution_of_India.pdf](https://github.com/arijitdeb1/AI-101/blob/main/Constitution_India_subset.pdf)

13. Implement required logic to intake user queries using a text area provided by **`streamlit`**.
14. Find the matching embeddings(from Vector Store) for user queries.
15. Define the LLM and required specifications.
16. Load the QA chain to LLM. The chain includes llm, matched embeddings, and user question.
17. print the response generated by LLM for the user query.
18. Refer [chatbot.py](https://github.com/arijitdeb1/AI-101/blob/main/chatbot.py) for complete code.
